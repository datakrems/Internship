"Photometry with Salsa J (based on the activity from Faulkes Telescope Education Program - Daniel Duggan & Sarah Roberts). Photometry is the measurement of the intensity or brightness in a particular waveband (e.g. the optical) of an astronomical object, such as a star or galaxy by adding up all of the light from the object. For example, a star looks like a point of light when you look at it just with your eyes but the Earth's atmosphere smears it out into something that looks like a round blob when you use a telescope to look at it. In order to measure the total light coming from the star, we must add up all of the light from the smeared out star. Photometry is used to generate light curves of objects such as variable stars and supernovae, where we are interested in variability of light output by the system over time. It can also be used to discover exoplanets or to estimate the mass of a black hole candidate, by measuring fluctuations in the intensity of a star's light over time. These instructions explain how photometry can be carried out on groups, or clusters of stars, from images taken with different filters, in order to plot a colour magnitude diagram. An explanation on magnitudes can be found at the end of this document in Appendix 1. Instructions Before we can start the photometry, we have to work out our aperture radius - this defines the radius of the circle that is used to count the pixel values in the image. The radius of the circle is very important - if the radius is too small, it will not count all the light coming from the star and if it is too big, it may count too much background sky or other stars in the image. Therefore you may not get accurate measurements. SalsaJ automatically sets the radius as the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of the stars in the image. The FWHM is used to describe the width of an object in the image. Stars in astronomical images have a specific profile when plotted as a graph of pixel values and that profile should be the same for each star in the image. The FWHM is a measure of the telescope's optics, the image recording CCD and the atmosphere through which the light passes. FWHM When determining the brightness of a star, the software sums the brightness over all pixels receiving light from that star. To do this the effective width of the star must be determined for each image before measuring the brightness of the stars on that image. One way to estimate the FWHM is to look at a slice across the star. The slice will probably look something like the diagram on the next page (without the arrows and label). The base of the slice is at the value for the background sky. The top of the peak represents the counts measured in the brightest pixel along the slice within the star. The difference between the top of the peak and the base is the height of the peak. The FWHM is the number of pixels across the peak at a point halfway up from the base. FWHM is displayed graphically like this: In order to do photometry, we recommend you work out your own optimum star radius in order to get more accurate results. To do this you must conduct a simple experiment, collect data and plot a graph - using Microsoft Excel (or another spreadsheet package that can plot graphs) makes this exercise much easier and quicker. The idea is to test several different aperture radii and compare the intensity values you get for each radius by plotting a graph of radius against intensity. To do this, go back to SalsaJ, then to Analyse>Photometry Settings. Select force Star Radius and choose the value 6. Next, go to Analyse>Photometry and another empty window will then appear entitled 'Photometry'. Using the mouse, click on a star in your image. The intensity of the object is calculated by adding up all the pixel values within the radius of the aperture. We can clearly see that the chosen radius is too small. Let's increase it a bit to 8. Click on the star again and a new measurement will appear. Still the radius is too small. Increase the value to 10 and continue until you reach a radius of 40 You should have something like this: In Excel (or other package) create two columns for Radius and Intensity then, add radius and the intensity value from SalsaJ. (You can save the values directly from the Photometry window in file.xls format and convert it to Excel. You should have a set of results that looks like this: Star's Star's Sky's Sky's Index Image X Y intensity radius intensity radius 1 ptstar2.fts 283 2 ptstar2.fts 283 211 34841 6 477 9 3 ptstar2.fts 283 4 ptstar2.fts 283 211 75460 8 300 12 5 ptstar2.fts 283 6 ptstar2.fts 283 211 117922 10 187 15 7 ptstar2.fts 283 8 ptstar2.fts 283 211 155160 12 123 18 9 ptstar2.fts 283 ptstar2.fts 283 211 187485 14 83 21 10 ptstar2.fts 283 11 ptstar2.fts 283 211 211802 16 62 24 12 ptstar2.fts 283 13 ptstar2.fts 283 211 229401 18 50 27 14 ptstar2.fts 283 15 ptstar2.fts 283 211 242610 20 43 30 16 ptstar2.fts 283 17 ptstar2.fts 283 211 252117 22 38 33 18 211 258799 24 36 36 211 264426 26 34 39 211 268427 28 33 42 211 271693 30 32 45 211 276987 35 31 52 211 279995 40 31 60 211 283728 50 31 75 211 284816 55 30 82 211 286119 60 30 90 We are interested in the variation of intensity with increasing aperture radius. When you plot a graph of this data, you should get something that looks like this: Counts Aperture Radius You can see the rapid rise of intensity as the radius of the aperture increases. This is because more of the star is included in the increasing radii of the apertures. The graph begins to flatten out when we have all of the star within the aperture, but keeps rising gradually as more and more of the background sky is included. From this graph, we can see that the best radius to use is about 10 - this is around the point where the star's intensity stops increasing so rapidly. There is however, not just one correct answer and a value of 12 or 14 could also be considered appropriate. Once you have chosen the best aperture radius, this can be set for the remainder of your photometry analysis on this image. It is advisable to carry out this exercise every time you come to work with a new set of images as the FWHM of objects change due to the seeing conditions at the time of observation so new aperture radii will need to be calculated for new images. However, if you are carrying out photometry on the star, but in two different wavelengths (such as B and V), then you should use the same radius for both images to ensure that you are comparing 'like with like'. Measuring the Counts of a Star Let's continue using the same images as before PTstar1 PTstar2. Now with the established value for the aperture of 18 we will measure the brightness in both images What is the brightness of PTstar1 in Counts? What is the brightness of PTstar2 in Counts? You will find out that the values greatly change from one image to the other. These images are actually of the same star and the star itself has not changed. However, they were taken on two different nights and the seeing certainly varied a lot. In these images we can't compare the brightness of the star with other stars in the field. So in the next activity we will choose a better target. When the field has more stars it is easy to make a mistake. If you are not sure you selected the correct star you can delete a line in the photometry measurements window by selecting the line, then chosing Edit in the Menu and then Cut. Comparing Two Images of the Same Region Images for this activity are listed below. In each image the target star is on the left and the reference star is on the right. This images containing a Cepheid Variable, a star with a very well know variability and very often used and to help evaluate distances to nearby galaxies. For this part of the activity we will use the following images: PTnight1, PTnight2, PTnight3, and PTnight4. You may open and work on these images simultaneously or one at a time.

"BLACK HOLES IN MY SCHOOL Observing Stellar Mass Black Hole Candidates This module integrates an online training course introducing participants to the use of the inquiry methodology and the integration of ICT tools in schools practices. This module is devoted to the implementation of a research based experiment where students can be involved in the identification of stellar mass black hole candidates and the procedure to measure their mass limits. Learning outcomes At the end of this module participants should know the procedure used to identify black hole candidates and how to determine the mass limits of a compact object in a binary system. Rationale This module introduces participants to the technique used to determine the mass limits of a compact companion to a visible star. Resources Set of images of black hole candidates Salsa J Excel Images and parts of the text credited to Fraser Lewis (Faulkes Telescope Educational Team) BHIMS is developed in the framework of the SoNetTE project Eclipsing Binary Stars The most common stellar mass black hole candidates live in binary systems where one of the components is a compact object (a black hole or neutron star) and the other a 'normal' star. The light curve of a binary system can allow us to study the different components. Take for instance the example below: In the case where one of the components is a compact object we only see the 'normal' star (usually a main sequence star or anevolved red giant). In the case of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs), these stars fill their Roche Lobes and therefore acquire a pear (or teardrop) shape. As the two objects orbit their common centre of mass, different parts of the system are visible to us. Depending on the Figure 1 Light curve of binary star Kepler-16 (Credit: NASA) inclination of the system (where 0° is a face-on orbit and 90° is an edge-on orbit) a limit on the mass of the compact object can be established. The image in Figure 2 shows the infrared light curve of the black hole candidate A0620-00. Depending on the position of the companion star and the compact object, with its accretion disc (see fig.4), we see different amounts of light coming towards the observer. Remember that we don't see the individual components; we only observe a dot whose brightness changes in time. It is from the study of these changes in the form of a light curve that we can start to infer some of its characteristics.

Images and parts of the text credited to Fraser Lewis (Faulkes Telescope Educational Team) BHIMS is developed in the framework of the SoNetTE project Finding the minimum mass for the black hole candidate XTE J1118+480 The object we will study is the black hole candidate XTE J1118+480. It was discovered in March 2000 by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite. It is approximately 6 000 light-years away in the constellation of Ursa Major. The system is composed of a compact object and a low mass star (less than 2 solar masses). The compact object is pulling matter from its companion and the intense, time-variable heating of this material in the accretion disc helped astronomers discover this object. This heating means that the disc emits copious amounts of X- rays. Figure 3 Location of the black hole candidate XTE J1118+480 (Credit: Black Hole Encyclopedia) The optical component of this system (the star; Figure 4 Here we find an artist impression of the KV UMa) already appeared in images (some binary system XTE J1118+480 composed by a low mass over 40 years old) and it appears to be star and a compact object. The material of the following a looping path that takes in out of the companion star is attracted by the intense disc of our Galaxy (see Figure 5). Studies of this gravitational field of the compact object forming an trajectory indicate that the object might have accretion disc. Credit: Hynes been inside a globular cluster and was probably kicked out after the supernova explosion of the massive progenitor star that gave birth to the compact object. The estimated mass of this black hole candidate is around 7 solar masses. This is precisely what we want to confirm with this exercise. Figure 5 Artist impression of the path of the XTEJ1118+480 through the disc of our Galaxy. Credit: STScI Images and parts of the text credited to Fraser Lewis (Faulkes Telescope Educational Team) BHIMS is developed in the framework of the SoNetTE project The data we will analyse are a sequence of 62 images obtained by Faulkes Telescope North taken on 13/05/2009. We will analyse this images using Salsa J and Excel. The images show several stars surrounding the object we wish to study. We will select some of these stars to be comparison stars in our study. The procedure is to make photometry measurements of all the comparison stars and the black hole candidate for all the images. If we are fortunate, the brightness (or intensity) of the comparison stars should remain constant (although there are variations in the images based on weather) as a function of time while the brightness of the binary system containing the black hole candidate should vary. By plotting the intensity against time we should see variability and can use this to estimate the mass of the non-visible compact object. Figure 6 The finding chart (the map of stars locating the object and the comparison stars). XTE J1118+480 is denoted by the two black lines the comparison stars are shown as 1, 2, 3. (Image from Faulkes Telescope North) First, we need to determine the best aperture radius before proceeding with the photometry. Figure 7 Evaluating the best aperture with Salsa J, as explained in the photometry lesson Images and parts of the text credited to Fraser Lewis (Faulkes Telescope Educational Team) BHIMS is developed in the framework of the SoNetTE project Previous studies show show that average star in this image has a FWHM of 4 pixeis In practice, a good choice for the radius of an aperture is about 1.5 or 2.0 times the FWHM. In the examples below the value used was 6 for the aperture radius. Now you can start to measure the intensity for the 3 comparison stars and for the black hole candidate. Make the measurements in each image for all 4 objects. Since the images are 2 Mb each, it is best to process no more than 20 images at a time. Alternatively, you can distribute the images amongst a group of students and collate the group's results later, ensuring that each group use the same aperture radius and the same comparison stars. You can choose to 'tile' them (in Salsa J, 'Tile' is under 'Window') which will make it easier to perform the procedure. It is important to process the images in order which is easy if you follow their number. Figure 8 Selection of 20 images, tiled and then reordered Make sure you adjust the brightness and contrast in all images in order to be able to see all the objects. If you can't see all of them don't use the particular image. Sometimes if you close and reopen the image the brightness and contrast appear better. Since we will be working with relative magnitudes, where we are comparing intensities of the comparison stars and the black hole candidate we don't have to worry about absolute magnitudes and standard stars etc. We are not looking for the absolute value of the magnitude of the object but the variations to its intensity relative to other stars in the same image. You will also need the Modified Julian Date (MJD) for each image. You find this information in the header of FTS images. In Salsa J you select the Show Info under the Image menu and in the header you will find the value for MJD. This is the value to be used on the x-axis of your graph. Images and parts of the text credited to Fraser Lewis (Faulkes Telescope Educational Team) BHIMS is developed in the framework of the SoNetTE project After removing a couple of images, your results should look like this: star 1 10000 star 2 9000 star 3 8000 xte J1118 7000 6000 5000 4000 3000 counts 54964.24506 54964.2528 54964.26055 54964.26829 54964.27603 54964.28377 54964.29263 54964.30037 54964.30905 54964.31678 54964.32451 54964.33576 54964.3435 54964.35124 54964.35897 54964.36671 54964.37761 54964.38534 54964.39307 54964.40339 Julian Date Figure 9 Plot of counts over time From this graph we can clearly see that our target varies far more than the comparison stars. We already know that the orbit of the visible star and compact object around each other is periodic. Finding the orbital period is complicated and time demanding. But we can make a rough estimate from the graph above since it is showing evidence that the whole period is in the set of images. We can try to adapt the value of the period that best fit our purposes. You students can play a bit with the value of the period and try to find the best fit. Scientists already know the period of this object P= 4.08 hrs = 0.17 days. (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...556...42W) A nice tutorial on the calculation of periodicity and determination of phase in variable systems can be found here: http://www.aavso.org/files/Chapter12.pdf The formula to transform the Julian dates in Phase is the following = 0 Where the MJD is given in the header of each image, T0 is the MJD of the first image and the period is 0.17 days.

"Observation Planning Observation Planning Using Stellarium to plan an observing session Author: Sarah Roberts Observation Planning Observation Planning - Using Stellarium to plan an observing session Stellarium Stellarium is free planetarium software which allows the night sky to be viewed from any location on Earth, on any date. The software can be downloaded from www.stellarium.org. A patch which sets up Stellarium so that its default location is at FTN, and an azimuthal grid is visible on the sky, is also available on the Faulkes Telescope website at: http://www.faulkes-telescope.com/index.php?page=186 With such a patch, the opening screen of Stellarium looks like the image here. The viewing direction is to the South (as noted by the S), the azimuthal grid is visible, and there are many deep sky objects which have been labelled. For users who have not downloaded the FT patch, the azimuthal grid and deep sky object names can be toggled on/off the sky by clicking on the grid and nebulae buttons shown here. The boxes at the bottom of the Stellarium screen can be selected or de-selected, to, among other things, turn on the names of the deep sky objects, label the constellations and remove the horizon from the screen. It is worth playing with these buttons to familiarise yourself with the different features in Stellarium. Page 2 of 6 Observation Planning - Using Stellarium to plan an observing session Setting the location for your FT observing session An important button on the tool bar in Stellarium is the 'Configuration Window' button - this is the spanner icon . By clicking on this button, a window appears. This window give the options for changing your date and time, and location, aswell as the landscape, video and rendering options. If you are using the down- loaded FT configuration patch, your location will automatically be set as the position of FTN. This can be changed to any other location (e.g FTS) by either clicking on the map, or by entering the longitude and latitude of the location underneath the map. Observation Planning Setting the date and time for your FT observing session From the configuration window menu, select 'Date & Time'. The next window will give you options for changing the date and time, time zone and time speed in Stellarium. Set the date and time to correspond to that of your FT observing session, Click on the square in the top right hand corner of the configu- ration window to close it once you are happy with the set up of the viewing time and loca- tion. Page 3 of 6 Observation Planning Observation Planning - Using Stellarium to plan an observing session Looking around the sky in Stellarium By clicking on the question mark button, or typing 'h' in the Stellarium window, you can see which keyboard buttons correspond to commands in Stellarium. For example, to zoom in/out of the sky in Stellarium, you can either use the roller ball of your mouse (if you have one), or use the 'Page Up/Down' buttons on your keyboard. The sky can be scrolled around by left clicking on it, and dragging it with the mouse. Alternatively, you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard. Setting up the best view to plan your FT observing session In order to use Stellarium to help you plan your FT observing session, the time, date and location should be set correctly through the configuration window. Next, zoom right out of the Stellarium window and scroll the sky until the zenith (the point directly overhead) is at the centre of the screen. The lowest altitude limit of the Faulkes Telescopes is 25 degrees. Thus, all objects which you choose for your observing session should be above 25 degrees from the horizon. Ideally, to minimize the amount of atmosphere the telescope looks through when observing, this limit should be anything above 30 degrees. Thus, any object within the 30 degree circle in the Stellarium view can be observed with the Faulkes Telescopes. The best order of observing can be decided from the positions of ob- jects in the sky. Page 4 of 6 Observation Planning Observation Planning - Using Stellarium to plan an observing session Selecting objects in Stellarium In order to zoom in on images in Stellarium, click on the object with the left mouse button, and press the space bar to centre on it. On the left we have centered upon NGC 7662. Now we wish to magnify the image. This is done by using the Page Up/Down keys on your keyboard, or your roller ball on your mouse. The zoomed in view of this object can be seen below. At the top left hand corner, some information is given on the selected object. Page 5 of 6 Observation Planning Observation Planning - Using Stellarium to plan an observing session When zooming in further on the object, a credit for the image is displayed, as shown below.

"Stellar mass black holes Black holes are regions of space time where gravity shows all its glory and triumph and are thus very important examples of applicability and importance of General Relativity. They are mysterious objects which existence is still not completely proved. To definite proof of their existence would be finding evidence of the existence of an event horizon, a point of no return. Until such proof arrives the correct attitude is to call them black hole candidates, no matter how promising the many observations of are. In spite of all this veil of mystery and uncertainty black holes are the simplest objects in the Universe. They can be completely characterized by only 3 parameters: charge, mass and angular momentum. This implies that black holes in the centre of galaxies and those living in stellar systems have only one fundamental difference: their mass. There are strong arguments implying that stellar mass black holes might be born from the supernovae which occur after the death of some high mas stars, stars with masses 8 times the mass of our Sun or bigger. These big stars have a very short existence (in the order of millions of years, which is very short when compared to the life of a star like our Sun. Our Sun exists for nearly 4.5 billion years (109 years) and is in halfway through its life time. The final stage of the life of a high mass star is in the form of a supernova explosion. The remains of the progenitor star are expected to be in general either a neutron star or a black hole, depending, in part, on the mass of the remaining object. So far we know nearly 2 dozen of very strong stellar mass black hole candidates in our own Galaxy. Their proximity turns them in real laboratories where we can study their characteristics and thus gain knowledge about their true nature and perhaps infer probable characteristics of those living in the centre of galaxies. An artistic view of a stellar mass black hole system is depicted in fig 1.

(Credit and Copyright: Robert Hynes) 1 How stellar mass black holes form? Let's begin by gaining some understanding of the life cycle of stars. Figure 2 Two different evolutionary cycles of stars depending on the initial mass (Credit: NASA) In figure 2 the life cycle of stars are presented depicting two major evolutionary paths, depending on the initial mass of the star. In the central part of this artist impression a nebula of gas and dust gives birth to stars with different masses. In the left part of the image it is represented the evolutive cycle of a low mass star (like our Sun), that will end up its life as a white dwarf. In the right part of the image it is represented the evolutive path of a high mass star that will end up as a neutron star or a black hole. The luminosity of stars during most of their lives is due to nuclear reaction where Hydrogen is being fused into Helium. These reactions are only possible due to the extreme temperatures existing in the interior of such objects. The radiative pressure that generates from such phenomena counterbalances the gravity field originated by the star's own mass, enabling the star to stay in a state of equilibrium. When the fuel diminishes (in this case Hydrogen), the radiation pressure diminishes and the star's core contracts due to the action of the gravitational field. There is an increase in temperature in the regions closer to the core, which makes it possible for the hydrogen combustion layer to move gradually towards the surface. The star, in search for a new equilibrium state, will expand. The radio of the star increases and the star transforms into a red giant or in a red supergiant depending on its initial mass. While the star expands the core contracts. There is a new increase in temperature and depending on the original mass of the star, the temperature and density may increase enough to originate new reactions and start transforming Helium core into a mixture of Carbon and Oxygen, or , in higher mass stars, oxygen, neon and magnesium. During this period the external layers of the star are dispersed in the interstellar medium (in high mass stars, the lost fraction represents a big part of the 2 total mass), while the core, where fuel (heavier elements) also starts to run out, continues to contract and heating to higher temperatures. The element transformation continues until the formation of Iron. Iron is a stable element and to transform it into heavier elements the star would need an external source of energy. From this moment on the star gets unstable and ends up in a supernova explosion where all the outer layers are released to the interstellar medium. Elements heavier then Iron are formed in this phase. Stars like our Sun (low mass stars) have a much longer life cycle, with a duration of the order of billions of years and end up their lives in the form of a white dwarf. They start by fusing their Hydrogen fuel into Helium. The gravitational field originated by the star mass is not enough to effectively ignite the fusion of Helium into heavier elements. Our Sun exists for at least 4.5 billion years and it is estimated that it is in half of its life cycle. Stars with a mass higher than 8 solar masses will follow a much shorter life cycle, of the order of millions of years. Due to their higher mass they need more fuel in order to maintain the equilibrium state, thus consuming more rapidly their source of energy. It is believed that their end state will be in the form of a neutron star or a black hole. White Dwarfs Figure 3 - NGC 2440 is a Planetary Nebula located 4000 light years away from Earth. The central star evolved to a white dwarf after ejecting its outer layers originating this beautiful planetary nebula (Credit: NASA & Hubble Heritage Team) Low mass stars end up their life cycle in a much more pacific way when the core slowly lose contact with the outer layer. High energy photons originating from the stellar core slowly excite the material of these outer layers, already very diluted and dispersed, producing as a result the incredible beautiful planetary nebula as the one in figure 3. 3 The remaining part of the star has the form of a white dwarf. In these stars matter is so compressed that atomic core are glued to each other. A state where there are no atoms only nuclei and free electrons. The collapse of the star is now stopped by the electrons degeneracy pressure, a pressure that emerges from the impossibility of 2 electrons occupying the same position at the same time. If we try to put 2 electrons in the same orbit an effect similar to electromagnetic repulsion, when we try to approach particles with the same charge, will appear. In this case the effect is known as the Pauli exclusion principle: two electrons can't occupy the same quantum state . In the core of the stellar remains the pressure is so large that the necessary conditions for such a force to appear and the degeneracy of electrons is then responsible for stopping the gravitational collapse, thus stabilizing the star. White dwarfs are extremely hot and emit thermal radiation. The first white dwarf observed was Sirius B, companion of Sirius, one of the brightest stars in our skies. Sirius B has a radius smaller than that of the Earth but has almost the same mass as our Sun. White dwarfs are so dense that a tea spoon of their material would weight 50 ton, by Earth standards! The discovery that the electrons degeneracy pressure could halt the collapse of a star was made by an Indian physicist, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, when he was 20 year old, while making the boat trip that took him from India to England where he was about to start his Phd. He calculated that only stellar remains that had a mass lower than 1.44 times the mass of the Sun could reach a state o equilibrium due to the electrons degeneracy pressure. This will be the destiny of our star, the Sun. When this limit is surpassed the continuation of the collapse is inevitable until the next stage, where it can be halted again in the formation of neutron stars. Neutron Stars Figure 4 - The Crab nebula (M1) in the direction of the constellation Taurus, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (lower left). The details to the right are showing a composite of visible light (red) and X-rays (blue) with the pulsar as central star. At the shock front in 0.3 light-years distance from the pulsar, the ultrarelativistic wind of electrons and positrons collides with the surrounding nebula. (Credits: NASA) 4 If the progenitor star has an initial mass higher than 8 solar masses, the transformation cycle of Hydrogen into Helium and so on towards heavier elements will continue until the stage where the core of the star is composed essentially by Iron. In order to transform iron in heavier elements it is necessary to find an external source of energy. In the absence of the radiative pressure from the core of the star the collapse is inevitable and very quick. The star loses contact with the outer layers. With a mass higher than 1.44 solar masses, the electron degeneracy pressure is not enough to halt the gravitational force and the star's core collapses. The electrons can't resist the gravitational pull and start interacting with protons from the core producing neutrons. In this case, and provided the mass is not higher than 3 solar masses, a new equilibrium state can be reached, this time due to the degenerative pressure of the neutrons, the quantum effect that prevent neutrons to occupy the same state. The pressure created by this package of neutrons will counterbalance the gravitational force and the star will reach a new equilibrium state in the form of a neutron star. In Figure 4 we can see an image of the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant, at a distance of 6 000 light years from Earth, first observed by the British amateur astronomer John Bevis. In the right hand side of the image we can see the interior of the nebula where a pulsar was observed (a neutron star that emits regular radio pulses). The pulsar is visible in the central part of the image. The rotational period of a pulsar is extremely small. In the case of the crab nebula's pulsar it is 33 times per second. Figure 5 High mass star's life cycle ends when the core is essentially constituted by Iron, a stable element that can't be transformed into heavier elements unless an external source of energy is provided to the star (Credit: NASA) As mentioned before, if the progenitor star has an initial mass around 8 solar masses, the transformation cycle continue until a state where the star's core is constituted essentially by Iron. At this stage the star resembles an onion where each layer is constituted by different elements, produced during the evolutionary cycle of the star. The outer layers that can't follow the collapse of the core undergoe a slower contracting process ending up with a collision with the degenerate core. This process ends up in the form of a supernova explosion type II, one of the most energetic phenomena in the Universe. In this phase the star releases into the interstellar medium all the elements that it has produced in its interior. The interaction of the radiation coming from the core with the star's layers, during the explosion, will generate the necessary energy for the emergency of elements heavier than Iron. This is the 5 mechanism with which the Universe is enriched with the elements for the periodic table that didn't exist in the primordial Universe, that was constituted basically by Hydrogen and Helium and a small quantity of Lithium. As Carl Sagan use to say, we are all children of the stars, all made of stardust. The remains of such an explosion, depending on the mass, can be a neutron star or a black hole. Neutron stars have usually a radius of around 10 km, usually with a mass of the order of 1.5 solar masses. The first detection of a neutron star was made by an Northern Ireland astronomer, Jocelyn Bell, a Phd student at the time of the discovery, in 1967. She discovered a radio signal that pulsed with such an amazing periodicity that at the beginning she thought could be a message from aliens. Soon it was confirmed to be a signal coming from a neutron star. These objects have intense magnetic fields (in fact they have the most intense magnetic field that we can measure in the Universe, billions of times stronger than the Earth's magnetic field). These magnetic fields originate the vibration of the electrons, responsible for the emission of radio waves. Neutron stars with such characteristics are known as pulsars. These are objects with fast rotation and their pulses can have a periodicity of milliseconds. The final effect is similar to the light emitted by lighthouses. Important to be noted however that not all neutron stars are pulsars. Black Holes If the remains of the progenitor star has a mass higher than 3 solar masses, which may happen in cases where the original star may have masses higher than 40 solar masses (the relation between the initial mass and the mass of the remaining object is not yet well established), then not even the degeneracy pressure of neutrons can stop the gravitational collapse and the star will contract due to its own gravitational field giving birth to a black hole. A black hole is by definition a region of the Universe where nothing can come out of, not even light. This sole property was responsible for the baptism of such obejcts as black holes by the theoretical physicist John Wheeler in 1967. In fact, the existence of objects where the scape velocity where higher than the speed of light (the minimum necessary speed for an object to escape the gravitational attraction of the body), was already predicted in 1783 by an English priest, John Michell, and in 1796 by Pierre Simon Laplace, both predictions based in the Newtonian Mechanics. The big change since then is that at the time this predictions where made it was not known that the speed of light was a limiting value. The escape velocity on Earth is 40.248 km/h, already reached by aerospace technology. However, if the density of our planet increased a lot, if we contracted the whole Earth to a radius of 10 mm then the scape velocity would increase and surpass the 300 000 km/s, a speed higher than the velocity of light, thus impossible to reach. In the framework of General Relativity the existence of black holes emerges as a marginal result to one of the most important solutions to Einstein equations, the solution discovered in 1915 by Karl Schwarzschild. This solution describes the vacuum region external to a static and spherical body. It is perfect to study the dynamics in the Solar System and provided important proofs of predictions made by Einstein's theory. This solution predicts that a body may contract to a value inferior to a 6 certain radius, the Schwarzschild radius (also known as event horizon), turning into a black hole. In km this value is equivalent to 3 times the mass of the star in solar mass units. G = Newton's gravitational constant = 6.67 x 10-11m3s-2kg-1 C= light speed = 3.00 x 108 m/s 1 Mʘ (1 Solar Mass) 1.99 x 1030 kg 13,34 x 10 11 M m3 2 m Schwarzchild Radius = 2 GM/c2 = 9 x 1016 kgm2 2 = 1,482 x 10 27 M kg = m 1,482 x 10 27 x 2 x 1030 M Mʘ M Schwarzschild Radius = 2 GM/c2 3 Mʘ Approximately 3 times the mass of the star in solar mass units and the result given in km. A typical black hole candidate has a mass of approximately 10 solar masses and an event horizon of approximately 30 km. Most neutron stars and black hole candidates discovered so far are part of a binary system composed by a star of a known spectral type and a compact object. The intense gravitational field of these objects will attract the material of the companion star forming an accretion disk around the compact object. The inner part of the disc is subject to a gravitational field more intense and emit higher energy radiation, in the X-ray part of the spectrum. This is the most effective method of discovering such objects, but is not the only one. How do we detect stellar mass black holes ? (these part of the text is only to get you familiarized with all characteristics related to this field of research) Figure 6 UHURU satellite (freedom in Swahili). Was the first satellite completely devoted to the study of cosmic X-ray sources. It discovered over 400 sources, among them several X-ray emitting binary systems. 7 From the 60's on astronomers started to have available the necessary technology to observe the sky in the X-ray waveband. Until then there was no knowledge of the existence of an X-ray emitting source in the Universe beyond our Sun. X-rays can't pass through our atmosphere, therefore only spacecraft above it can study the Universe in this wavelengths. The first such device was launched in 1962 by a team of North American scientists. The Italian Ricardo Giacconi, who won the physics Nobel Prize in 2002 for his contribution for X-ray astronomy, was among them. The first discovered source was Sco X-1, receiving this name for being the first X-ray source in the constellation of Scorpius. At that time this source was a mystery to the astronomers: it emitted thousands of time more energy in X-ray than in visible light, and in this waveband the source was billions of times brighter than the Sun! These mysterious sources of radiation started to be unveiled with the launch of the UHURU satellite (Figure 6). This event marked the beginning of a new era of important discoveries unveiling a completely different Universe that could not be seen in the optical. Nowadays there are several active satellites observing the sky in X-ray: Chandra (NASA), XMM- Newton (ESA), RXTE (NASA), ALEXIS (LANL). Compact Object High Mass Star Accretion Disk Figure 7 Scheme of the mechanism of accretion by stellar winds. Credit: NUCLIO (C.Zurita) 8 Hundreds of X-ray sources where detected so far, concentrated in the plane of our Galaxy. Many of these sources are binary systems composed by a star of a known spectral type and a compact object. The gravitational field of this object attracts the material of the companion star. In the regions closer to the compact object high energetic phenomena take place and we can observe the emission of X- rays. In the cases where the non-visible component is a neutron star or a black hole they are called X-ray binaries. If the compact object is a white dwarf, in spite the fact that they are also sources of X- ray, they are called cataclysmic variables. This last case is easy to spot since their X-ray emission is not as intense as in the case of the more compact objects. In an interesting paradox, these extremely compact objects are almost impossible to detect when isolated. They are discovered for being responsible for extremely energetic phenomenon that for a short period of time transform them into strong X-ray emitters. Neutron stars and black holes are responsible for the most energetic phenomena in the Universe, they can be discovered via their interaction with the surrounding medium or objects such as those in binary sytems. The first system detected, in which the compact object is a strong stellar mass black hole candidate, was Cygnus X-1, in 1972 by the UHURU satellite. It is estimated that the compact object has a mass of the order of 5 times the mass of the Sun concentrated in a few kilometres. Its luminosity is due to accretion of matter coming from the companion star, a blue supergiant. Supergiant stars are continuously losing mass due to stellar winds. Part of this gas can be attracted by the compact object releasing X-rays (figure 7). The gas may then form a small accretion disk. In the inner regions of this disc energy might reach high levels, so high that we can observe X-rays. Figure 8 Scheme of a binary system formed by a Be star and a neutron star. The X-ray emission occurs when the neutron star, in a particular point of its orbit, enters the circumstellar disk and attracts part of the gas. The X-ray flux increases abruptly at each passage of the neutron star throughtout the disc. Credit: NUCLIO (C.Zurita) 9 The high mass companion star can also be of the Be type. The B stars are high mass stars much hotter and much bigger than our Sun. The Be are a subtype of this category and is characterized by having a circumstellar disc formed, probably, by the mass of the star lost from the equatorial zones due to its fast rotation. The binary systems formed by a Be star and a neutron star will also produce X-rays if the neutron star, at a certain point of its orbit around the star, penetrates the disc and accrete part of the gas and are therefore known as Be/X-ray binaries. There are other 2 types of systems in which the companion star has a lower mass than the Sun e therefore are called low mass X-ray binaries. In these systems the accretion is produced by the material overflowing the Roche lobe, the volume around the star within which the material is gravitationally attached to it. In a binary system, there is a common point between the Roche lobe of the two components, the so called Lagrange point. This is the equilibrium point between the gravitical forces of the two components of the system, in other words, a point where any object would be equally attracted by the star and the compact object. Figure 9 Scheme of a low mass X-ray binary with Roche lobes represented. The star fill its Roche lobe and acquires the shape of a pear. All material inside the yellow lobe is attached to the star e in the blue lobe to the compact object. The gas in the Lagrange point will flow through this point in the direction of the higher gravitational field. The flux carries with it the angular momentum of the star (rotating at the same speed as the star), thus it won't fall directly to the compact object forming around the star an accretion disc. The point of impact of the gas flow with the disc is called hot spot for being hotter and brighter than the disc itself. In the internal regions of the disc the potential energy of the gas is so high that will originate X-rays. The Lagrange point is of particular importance since it is the simplest route for the gas to flow from one star to the other. In certain phases of the evolution of the star it can fill its Roche Lobe. This happens in low mass binaries where the star will deform until acquiring the form of a pear. The gas 10 existing in the external regions, near the Lagrange point will then be attracted by the compact object. Since the system is rotation, the material being transferred will fall in spiral shape in the direction of the compact component forming an accretion disc around it. The accretion process produces X-ray and via reprocessing in the disc, visible radiation. Eventually the accretion mechanism via overflow of the Roche lob can also appear in high mass systems alongside with accretion from solar winds. The fact that we observe X-rays is not an evidence of the existence of black holes. It is an evidence of the existence of a compact object, which can be a white dwarf, a neutron star or a black hole. The case of white dwarfs is easily solved since, among the binaries with a compact object; these are the weakest X-ray emitters. However, if the compact object is a neutron star or a black hole, than the distinction is more complicated since the gravitational potential of a black hole and a neutron star is very similar and their observational properties very similar. If the binary system contains a neutron star, as seen before, may emit regular pulses. Since the magnetic field of the neutron star is very intense the gas may be accreted by the magnetic poles producing the same effect as a light house emitting radio pulses. These systems are so called X-ray pulsars. Sometimes the magnetic field are not so strong, as in the case of the low mass X-ray binaries, and the pulses are not so regular but more erratic and unstable. In these cases we say that they present quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). In addition they can also produce thermonuclear flashes in the surface of the neutron star. The flashes are produced when the gas (mainly hydrogen) accreted accumulates in the surface until the conditions are appropriate to start nuclear reactions that first consumes the Hydrogen and then the resulting Helium. Since Helium's fusion is explosive flashes can be observed with more or less regularity. In summary, if we observe pulses or flashes in a X-ray binary, we can be sure it contains a neutron star. But not all neutron stars emit pulses or flashes. In such cases, one way to distinguish between a neutron star and a black hole is by determining the mass of the non-visible component. If the mass of the object is above 3 solar masses than we have a strong black hole candidate. 11 Figure 10 Artistic impression of Centaurs X-3 a high mass X-ray binary located at 30 000 light years from Earth. The compact object is a neutron star with a mass around 0.8 solar masses in orbit around a blue super giant. This was the first system where periodic X-ray pulses where detected. (Credit: Dany Page) How can we determine the mass of a stellar mass black hole ? Most stars live in binary systems. If one of the components of the systems have enough mass, it will end up its days in the form of a supernova. The remain will be transformed into a compact object, a neutron star or a black hole. If the binary system survives the supernova explosion, it can then create a low mas X-ray binariy (or LMXB). We only know about 150 such objects in our Galaxy, a low number when compared to the 100 billion stars in our Galaxy. From these 150 less than 2 dozen have an estimate for the minimum mass of the compact object. It is precisely from the orbit of stars around non visible objects that we can determine the mass of the compact component in a X-ray binary. 12 Low mass star filling its Roche Lobe Compact Object Matter flowing from the companion start to the compact object Accretion Disk Figure 11 Artist impression of the low mass X-ray binary A0620-00. Discovered in 1975 it rapidly became a promising stellar mass black hole candidate, a prototype to the study of other candidates. However, the definitive determination of its mass was not yet possible and the limits to its value are too close to the limiting value for a neutron star, around 3 solar masses. (Credit: Robert Hynes) Low mass X-ray binaries are almost always detected by being strong X-ray emitters. In some of these systems the strong emission phase is a transient phase, i.e., has a very short duration. In these systems the flow of matter in the direction of the compact object has a spasmodic behaviour. Most of the time, matter coming from the star will accumulate in the outer parts of the disc until an instability is generated and the gas us suddenly accreted. An intense eruption is produced and the brightness of the system may have a variation of 5 to 6 magnitudes. After a period that might last a few months the system returns to its normal rhythm, a phase coined as quiescent phase. In this phase all the important studies to determine this system's parameters take place. Contrary to what happens in persistant X-ray binaries, in which the emission coming from the disc continues, in the transient X-ray binaries the intense emission stops and allows other characteristics of the system to be observed. Once the accretion disc stops being so bright, the companion star becomes visible again. The X-ray transients go completely unnoticed in the middle of hundreds of millions of stars until the moment of the eruptions. The interval between eruptions in these cases is very long taking sometimes decades to take place again. For this reason the discovery of such objects is not so frequent. 13 The mass function Figure 12 Scheme of a binary system. The compact object (mass M1) and the companion star (mass M2) are orbiting the centre of mass (CM) of the system with radical velocity K1 and K2 respectively. Since the compact object is not visible we have to extract all the necessary information by observing the companion star and its orbit. Credit: NUCLIO (C.Zurita) When a transient system is discovered, it is necessary to wait several months for the star to be responsible for the major emission coming from the binary system and not the disc. By then the observation of the companion star are crucial in order to determine the orbital parameter of the system and be able to apply Kepler's third law. This law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the average distance between the components of the system. We have to remember that Kepler's third law emerges naturally from the application of the Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation to the movement of planets and can therefore be generalized to any two bodies orbiting each other. With the application of Kepler's law to the star we are closer to our objective, determining the mas of the invisible compact object around which the other star is orbiting, i.e., determine the mass of the possible black hole. After some mathematical manipulation in the formula of Kepler's third law we end up in a relation between the orbital parameters of the binary system: where M1 and M2 are the masses of the compact object and the companion star respectively, P the orbital period, i.e., the time it takes for the star to complete an orbit, G is the universal gravitational constant, i is the inclination of the orbital plane of the system with with the line of sight of the observer and K2 the radial velocity of the visible star. If we are interested in an lower limit for the mass of the compact object, not exactly its mass, then things are much simpler. The mass of the star M2 can't be smaller than zero, neither the inclination angle can be higher than 90 degrees whi ch implies that the mass of the compact object has to be necessarily bigger than the quantity that is left when we make i= 90º and M2 =0, i.e.: 14 This quantity, called the mass function f(M)is extremely important since it allows us to obtain in simple mode the indirect evidence for the existence of black holes. If f(M) is higher than 3 solar masses, the mass of the compact object will certainly be higher than this limiting value and, as we already discussed, a neutron star must have a limiting mass smaller than this value. So we can conclude that the compact object must be a black hole. It seems very paradoxal that one of the best evidences for the existence of one of the most exotic objects ever imagined by physicists, and the best example of the applicability of general relativity, comes from the application of simple Newtonian mechanics. The radial velocity of the star Fingerprint of the star's chemical components Star with no motion Star moving away Star moving towards the observer Figure 13 The analysis of the spectral lines of a star allows us to determine its composition. When the star is moving the spectral lines appear to be shifted from the position they would have in a stationary reference frame. If the object is moving away from the observer the lines will appear to be shifted towards red. If the object is approaching the observer the lines will appear to be shifted towards the blue part of the electromagnetic spectrum. (Credit: NASA) In order to calculate the mass function, besides the orbital period that can be easily determined by observing the visible star, we also need to know its radial velocity, the velocity in the direction of the observer. This can be determined by the Doppler effect: if an emitting source is moving, the wavelength of the signal , measuring by an observer at rest, changes according to the velocity of the source. This effect explains why the whistle of a train (sound waves) acquire a lower pitch (a smaller 15 wavelength) when it moves away. Although it is not possible to listen to the stars, the Doppler effect can be also applied. The light of the stars are produced by nuclear reactions in their core having to cross the whole star before being released to space. A typical star like our Sun is fundamentally composed by Hydrogen and small quantities of other elements such as Helium, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, etc. When the light goes through them, these elements absorb certain wavelengths depending on the element. As a result, the observed spectrum is full of lines. In the cas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 but it doesn't give us the mass of the black hole. In order to have such value we need the radial velocity of the star, the resulting luminosity curve is a perfect ellipsoidal. In the image of the centre it is not possible to observe any variability since the star presents to the observer always the same surface. All other cases are more difficult to evaluate. For instance systems with an inclination of 45º. (Credit: Steven Degennaro) Fortunately there is a way to know the inclination angle. As we saw previously, the low mass star fills its Roche lobe and assumes the shape of a pear. This will have as a consequence that the star will show to the observer different faces during its orbital movement, i.e., light coming from the star will appear modulated, with two maxima in brightness when the star presents itself to the observer sideways, i.e., the largest surface, and two minima when it presents the frontal and the posterior surface. Since this is an effect that depends only on the geometry of the binary system, the amplitude of the modulation, so called ellipsoidal modulation, depends strongly to the inclination angle. 16 Figure 15 This image depicts the ellipsoidal modulation of a binary system with an inclination of 40º. We can easily verify that the phases of higher luminosity are those in which the system is seen sideways. The orbital phase defines the position of the star in its orbit. For convention, we can this phase zero the one in which the star is in front of the disc presenting its posterior part to the observer. The crosses are real data from the Cen X-4 system. Comparing the real curve (the crosses) with the model (continuous line) we can measure the inclination angle. Cen X-4 is one of the few transient binaries that appear to have a neutron star and not a black hole. (Credit: T.Shahbaz Knowing the luminosity of the star it is simple to create artificial ellipsoidal curves for all possible inclination angles. The comparison with the real curve (the crosses) obtained by the change in brightness of the star with the theoretical curves, gives us the measure for the inclination angle. Gathering all the information will lead us to the mass of the black hole candidate. 17 Black Holes: eternal candidates Figure 16 This image depicts 17 strong stellar mass black hole candidates. Fourteen low mass and three high mass. (Credit: J. Orosz) Even in the case where the mass is determined with good accuracy the object will still be called a black hole candidate. We have very strong evidence but not a definitive proof. We can only prove that in the particular region exists a compact object that will very likely be a black hole. However, the strong emission coming from the accretion disc doesn't allow us to observe the internal region. The compact object is completely unreachable. Some sceptical scientists for instance state that our knowledge about the equation of state of a neutron star is not yet enough to guarantee that they may not have more than 3 solar masses. But against this argument there is strong experimental evidence. All neutron stars we know so far have a mas smaller than 1.5 solar masses. However the object that we think can be a black hole may be something science has not predicted yet. The definitive proof would come if we could prove the existence of an event horizon, an unique characteristic of a black hole. 18 Figure 17 In the upper part of this image we find some of the most important black hole candidates and the indication of their masses. In the bottom part we can find the systems where the compact object is a neutron star. We can easily verify that in the last case the masses are all in an interval lower than 1.5 solar masses. In the 90s, R. Narayan, made an interesting observation. Those systems that could be observed in quiescent phase, the X-ray emission of the black hole candidates was lower than the emission of the system containing neutron stars. This might be the solution. The explanation is very simple, if the gas coming from the accretion disc finds the surface of the neutron star, new reaction will take place as the radiatin is re-emitted. If however there is an event horizon, than the gas will be forever lost. This characteristic will have as a consequence that neutron stars will emit more radiation, in the quiescent phase, than black hole candidates. 19 Figure 18 Artist impression of two binary systems containing a compact object. In the upper part the compact object is a black hole and in the bottom part a neutron star. The distinction between these two systems may be identified by observing their X-ray emission. Because a neutron star doesn't have an event horizon it will emit more radiation than a black hole. (Credit: Harvard Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics) The big problem is that the number of know systems is very low and thus a statistical analysis, that will allow diminishing the error is yet not possible. What if the black hole doesn't belong to a binary system? Would it be possible to detect their existence? Black holes in the centre of galaxies don't belong to binary systems, how can we measure their mass? We will have the opportunity to explore this later. Super and mini black holes Figure 19 This image shows the correlation between the mass of the black hole and the mass of the central bulge of the Galaxy. Studies in the last decade suggest that all galaxies might have a central black hole with masses that can reach billions of solar masses. (Credit: NASA) 20 Stellar mass black holes are miniature versions of the black holes existing in the centre of galaxies their difference being, as referred before, their mass. Some black holes mark their presence by being responsible for extremely energetic phenomena associated to quasars (active galactic nuclei that are at a great distance and thus in a far-off past). Other black holes prefer to remain anonymous as for instance the black hole in the centre of our Galaxy, with a mass of approximately 3 million Suns and appearing to be in a calm phase. Its presence is inferred by the study of the trajectory of some stars around it, which can only be explained by the presence of a high mass object in the region. This region is called Sgr A*, first classified as a radio source in Sagittarius, as we can see in Fig 20. Figure 20 Scheme of the trajectory of a star around what shall be the black hole in the centre of our Galaxy. Credit: ESO If today we have a satisfactory theory for the formation of stellar mass black holes the same can't be said about these monsters that inhabit the centre of galaxies. Some scientists believe that they might have been the seeds that originated the galaxies. These black holes might have appeared in the early stages of our Universe and attracted matter existing around it, thus forming the galaxies. Other scientists believe that the chaotic movement of matter in the early stages of the formation of our Universe might have originated regions of greater density. These regions would be in the origin of galaxies. Under the action of their own gravity they contracted and attracted matter that was in the neighbourhood becoming bigger and bigger. This same process of contraction could have originated black holes by forming more compact concentration of matter. 21 Figure 21 The Galaxy M87 hosts one of the first black holes discovered in the centre of a Galaxy, which might have billions of times the mass of our Sun. In the image we can see a zoom of the central region where the gigantic black hole might be hidden and the jet emitted with an extension of at least 5 000 light years. The existence of black holes with great mass started to be considered due to the discovery of quasars. Quasars are the farthest objects we can observe in the Universe. The fact that they are so far away and yet can be observed indicates that they are very bright sources: one quasar emits as much light as a thousand galaxies concentrated in a region equivalent to the Solar System. Another characteristic of quasars is that they present highly energetic jets of gas. There are also galaxies that have jets coming from their central region. The nuclei of these galaxies (The so called Active Galaxies) have properties very similar to the quasars. Since light travels with a finite velocity, the hipernovaes. It is a similar process to the explosion of a supernova, in which the progenitor star probably had high mass. In this case, strong gama ray emissions are observed associated to the final stage of the life of these stars. The remains of such stars will be a black hole surrounded by the material of the recently ejected star. In the accretion disc, and for reasons not yet fully understood, a jet of highly energetic particles may originate and by interacting with the expelled layers of the star will originate a phenomena known as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). We already heard about stellar mass black holes with 5 20 solar masses and about black holes in the centre of galaxies with billions of times the mass of the Sun. Are there black holes with intermediate mass?The theory of black holes studies so far puts no constraint on the size of the black holes. They can be gigantic as the now found in the centre of galaxies or as small as a particle. There is thus no reason for the nonexistence of the ones with intermediate size; the problem is how to detect them. The task is difficult but might not be impossible. 23 Microgravitational lenses originated by a black hole Star Star Star Light coming from the star Black Hole Black Hole Black Hole Earth Earth Earth Star Star Star Before During After Figure 23 A black hole might pass between the observer and a distant object originating an effect known as gravitational lenses . Credit: NASA. The black hole acts as a magnifying lens increasing the luminosity of the object, in this specific illustration a star. Some of these objects may be lonely travellers in the Universe. This is the case of MACHOs (Massive Compact Halo Objects). These objects reveal their present via gravitational lenses effect, an effect predicted by Albert Einstein. So far only 3 black hole candidates were detected using this method with masses varying from 3 to 6 solar masses. But these are well within the stellar mass black holes mass range. What about intermediate masses? 24 Figure 24 Relation between the mass of the black hole and the globular cluster. Globular clusters contain the oldest stars in the Universe. If it is proved that they harbour black holes in their central region than they probably already had them when they formed. Some of this objects are being discovered since the 90s. Some globular clusters, the case of M15 for instance, may host black holes with masses of the order of 4000 solar masses. Black hole candidates found in globular clusters seem to also have a direct relation with the mass of its host. It seems that there is an yet unknown mechanism that connects black holes to its host. Figure 25 The existence of a black hole candidate may be evidenced by the study of the behaviour of stars around the central nuclei. Credit: NASA 25 We know around 26 good black hole candidates in binary systems with masses up to a few tens solar masses; 4 candidates outside binary system also with small masses; around 10 with intermediate mass and 73 with masses that may go up to billions of solar masses. (august / 2014) (http://blackholes.stardate.org/objects/type.php?p=stellar-mass) But the story doesn't end here, there are still the mini black holes. These are the so called primordial black holes, predicted by Stephen Hawking and Brando<n Carter in the 70s and should have appeared in the primordial Universe due to density fluctuations of matter filling the space-time. Some authors even make comparative studies between these mini black holes and exotic particles, finding interesting common factor between both. However there are no experimental evidences of their existence so far. In the other extreme of our imagination are the universal black holes . Some scientists believe that even our Universe may be inside one of these, or more correctly, in the interior of a white hole, an object that is exactly the same thing as black hole, but in this case, its event horizon is a place where everything can go out but nothing can come in. Black holes are everywhere and in fact we know very little about their mysterious existence. They seem to exist from small to big scales, in different theories and predictions are that our own Universe will someday end up in a vast," dark emptiness filled with nothing but black holes.

"Six Thinking Hats Edward de Bono's (2000) Six Thinking Hats is a widely adopted creativity technique in various fields such as business management, education, and human-computer interaction. Essentially, Six Thinking Hats provides directions for adopting different modes of thinking, characterized by six coloured hats: White, Red, Black, Yellow, Green and Blue (Table 1). Table 1: Six colour hats, focus of thinking and implication to Go-Lab inquiry learning phases Thinking hats Focus Inquiry Learning Phases Applicable Facts Figures Facts, Orientation, Conclusion, Discussion: Information Figures Call for information known and Information needed, which can be provided by a teacher, peers and other sources. Such information may need to be referenced for supporting discussion as well as conclusion. Intuition Intuition, Discussion: In reflecting and Emotion Feeling & communicating experiences and Emotion insights gained in the learning Judgment process, students may express Caution feelings and emotions (e.g., fun, pride, frustration, surprise) to make their points. Judgment Conceptualization, Investigation: & Caution Spot the difficulties and risks; find out where and why things may go wrong. In formulating questions and hypotheses, it is critical to think about counterarguments and potential pitfalls. Logical Positive Logical Conceptualization, Investigation, Positive Conclusion: Explore the positives and probe for value and benefit. Optimism (but remain alert to biases) sustains engagement in the process. Creativity Creativity & Conceptualization: Identify the Changes Alternatives possibilities, alternatives and new ideas; an opportunity to express new concepts and new perceptions. Overview Overview All phases: It works as a control Process control Process mechanism to ensure that the control guidelines for different modes of thinking are observed. It is essentially a meta-cognitive strategy. Normally this creativity technique is applied in a group setting. Participants can wear real physical hats or mental ones (i.e., by asking all group members to utter loudly together the colour of the hat or presenting the image of the hat in a way perceivable by all of them). To ensure that participants are aware of the specific thinking mode they are in, thereby thinking with the same focus, it is important that putting on and taking off hats are performed as explicit actions (i.e., gesturing or verbalizing the change of hat). Also, group members should use the same colour hat simultaneously. By switching hats, participants can refocus or redirect their thoughts and interactions (verbal as well as non-verbal). Furthermore, the hats can be used in any order that is deemed appropriate and can be repeated as many times as necessary to address the issue at hand. In fact, the Six Thinking Hats technique has been applied to teach STEM subjects (Childs, 2012; Garner & Lock, 2010) with several advantages being identified. In summary, it can: reflect the process of experimentation within STEM subjects; help simplify and hence provide focus on one process at a time; enable a collaborative group learning activity; provide a common language within a group, while removing ego and reducing confrontation; promote creativity and problem solving; stimulate diversity of thought and empathy; foster evaluation skills leading back to improving processes and testing new hypothesis; Implementing Six Thinking Hats in the Go-Lab basic pedagogical model is relatively straightforward, as illustrated and described in Figure 1. Note that the teacher is required to orchestrate the process of switching hats, because it is a collaborative activity. However, if the class size is big, synchronizing the process may be somewhat difficult. Alternatively, the class can be split into smaller groups. For each group, a group leader is identified; he or she is responsible to coordinate the timing for changing hats and to ensure that members are applying the same focus (Table 1) to think about the issue under scrutiny. Figure 1: Example of applying different colour Thinking Hats to the inquiry learning phases While Figure 1 exemplifies which colour Hats are applicable for which inquiry learning phases, there is much leeway for a teacher (or a student group leader) to adapt the use of Hats based on the abilities as well as preferences of group members, the group dynamics, and certain situational factors.

The Physics of Color:</strong><br>How is it possible that people can see some colors and not others?<br>Electromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390 nm to 700 nm), it is known as ""visible light"".<br>Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's spectrum is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength.<br>Why we can see a combination of colors?.<br>When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390 nm to 700 nm), it is known as ""visible light"". These combinations offer different colors.</p><p><br><strong>3. Primary colors:</strong><br>Here we will answer the previous questions. What are the primary colors and how their combination can generate other colors, are there different types of combinations?<br>Primary colors (or primary colours) are sets of colors that can be combined to make a useful range of colors. For human applications, three primary colors are usually used, since human color vision is trichromatic. For additive combination of colors, as in overlapping projected lights or in CRTdisplays, the primary colors normally used are red, green, and blue. For subtractive combination of colors, as in mixing of pigments or dyes, such as in printing, the primaries normally used are cyan, magenta, and yellow, though the set of red, yellow, blue is popular among artists (see RGB color model, CMYK color model, and RYB color model for more on these popular sets of primary colors).<br>Any particular choice for a given set of primary colors is derived from the spectral sensitivity of each of the human cone photoreceptors; three colors that fall within each of the sensitivity ranges of each of the human cone cells are red, green, and blue. Other sets of colors can be used, though not all will well approximate the full range of color perception. For example, an early color photographic process, autochrome, typically used orange, green, and violet primaries. However, unless negative amounts of a color are allowed the gamut will be restricted by the choice of primaries. The combination of any two primary colors creates a secondary color (See the primary colors figure below).</p>",100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,25%,0%,0%,0%,0%,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"<p>The roots of modern-day EPFL can be traced back to the foundation of a private school under the name École spéciale de Lausanne in 1853 at the initiative of Lois Rivier, a graduate of the École Centrale Paris and John Gay, the then professor and rector of the Académie de Lausanne. At its inception it had only 11 students and the offices was located at Rue du Valentin in Lausanne. In 1869, it became the technical department of the public Académie de Lausanne. When the Académie was reorganised and acquired the status of a university in 1890, the technical faculty changed its name to École d'ingénieurs de l'Université de Lausanne. In 1946, it was renamed the École polytechnique de l'Université de Lausanne (EPUL). In 1969, the EPUL was separated from the rest of the University of Lausanne and became a federal institute under its current name. EPFL, like ETH Zurich, is thus directly controlled by the Swiss federal government. In contrast, all other universities in Switzerland are controlled by their respective cantonal governments. Following the nomination of Patrick Aebischer as president in 2000, EPFL has started to develop into the field of life sciences. It absorbed the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) in 2008.[12]</p>",100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,100%,TRUE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"<p>In 1946, there were 360 students. In 1969, EPFL had 1,400 students and 55 professors. In the past two decades the university has grown rapidly and as of 2012 roughly 14,000 people study or work on campus, about 9,300 of these being Bachelor, Master or PhD students. As EPFL first became a federal institute under its current name in 1969, with a student body of then less than 1500, the university is included in the Times Higher Education list of top 100 universities under 50 years old. The environment at modern day EPFL is highly international with the school now attracting top students and researchers from all over the world.

"Like every public university in Switzerland, EPFL is obliged to grant admission to every Swiss resident who took the maturitÃ© high-school certificate recognized by the Swiss Federation. However, international students are required to have a final grade average of 80% or above of the maximum grade of the upper secondary school national system. As such, for Swiss students, EPFL is not selective in its undergraduate admission procedures. The real selection process happens during the first year of study. This period is called the propaedeutic cycle and the students must pass a block examination of all the courses taken during the first year at the end of the cycle. If the weighted average is insufficient, a student is required to retake the entire first year of coursework if they wish to continue their studies at the school. Roughly 50% of students fail the first year of study, and many of them choose to drop out rather than repeat the first year.[13] The failure rate for the propaedeutic cycle differs between fields of study, it is highest for Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering majors where only 30""""40% of students pass the first year. For foreign students, the selection procedure towards the undergraduate program is rather strict, and since most undergraduate courses are taught in French, foreign students must provide documentation of having acquired a level B2 proficiency as measured on the CEF scale, though C1 proficiency is recommended. As at all universities in Switzerland, the academic year is divided into two semesters. Regular time to reach graduation is six semesters for the Bachelor of Science degree and four additional semesters for the Master of Science degree. Though only 58% of the student's who manage to graduate are able to graduate within this time-period.[13] The possibility to study abroad for one or two semesters is offered during the 3rd year of study under certain conditions as EPFL maintains several long-standing student exchange programs, such as the junior year engineering and science program with Carnegie Mellon University in the United States, as well as a graduate Aeronautics and Aerospace program with the ISAE in France. The final semester is dedicated to writing a thesis. Entrepreneurship is actively encouraged to foster a start-up culture among the student body as evident by the EPFL Innovation Park being an integral part of campus. Since 1997, 12 start-ups have been created per year on average by EPFL students and faculty. In the year 2013, a total of 105 million CHF was raised by EPFL start-ups.[14]",100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,100%,TRUE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Homepage Hacker Noon AMA W/ BLOCKSTACK CEOAILATESTTOP2.0CRYPTODEVJOIN COMMUNITY A guide to giving your cats their annual performance review Go to the profile of Thryn Thryn Dec 19, 2016  My cat Linus, who is kind of a jerk but I just love his fuzzy little face. As the year draws to a close, it’s time to sit down with your cats and give them feedback on how they’ve been performing. To help you prepare for the conversation, I’ve written a few guidelines from my own experiences.  Evaluate against a standard When thinking about how your cat is meeting expectations, ensure that you are evaluating against a standard. It should take into account the cat’s level which is ultimately based on age and breed. A level 2 cat such as a 6 month old Persian kitten will not have the same performance expectations as a level 5 cat like an 8-year-old gray tabby. Ideally you’ve discussed these expectations with your cat at length. They should be reasonable and achievable while still providing enough of a challenge to allow for personal growth. Some sample performance goals can include: number of hours of expected sleep during the day (aim for 16–18); time spent playing in boxes; level of cuteness on a scale from 1–10 (this should be maintained with self-grooming and a general posture of perky ears and wide eyes).  Focus on impact In order to help your cat grow, your feedback must be specific and actionable. By using the situation-behavior-impact (SBI) model, your cat will be able to understand the rationale behind your feedback. An example conversation might go: “Skittles, when I was sleeping and you jumped on the bed and meowed in my face at 4am, it woke me up and that made me feel angry and tired all day. One way you can have more positive impact is to STFU and sleep until at least 8am.”  How to frame a needs-improvement discussion This can be challenging. Your cat might get defensive, or worse, ignore you entirely and pretend that she doesn’t understand you. Don’t be fooled. She understands everything you say. When your cat is not meeting expectations, you’ll need to be prepared with a performance improvement plan or PIP. This PIP should include specific steps your cat will need to take in order to meet the expectations of her role and level. You can tell her, for example, that the number of times she jumps on the counter and gets her poo-poo paws all over your food prep areas is unacceptable and must be reduced by at least 80% over the next quarter.  It may be necessary to remind her just what a lucky SOB she is to have food and a warm place to sleep on these cold winter nights. Help your cat understand the consequences if performance does not improve. It may be necessary to remind her just what a lucky SOB she is to have food and a warm place to sleep on these cold winter nights. As your cat’s manager, you should also be aware of your own role in her performance. Are you present enough? Does she get adequate space to grow, play? Have you provided the necessary toys and furniture to scratch? It’s unfair to punish your cats for scratching the couch and destroying your nice things if you haven’t given them a proper scratching post.  Cupcake Schoolbus tries to demonstrate impact by destroying my f-ing blinds. When to give team feedback vs individual feedback You should be having regular individual 1:1s with your cats. Any negative feedback should be given privately so as not to embarrass or shame one cat in front of the group. However, some feedback can be given in a group setting when it benefits the whole team. For example, you can share with all of your cats how much you appreciate their adorable fuzzy faces and how cute they are when they make biscuits on your lap before curling up for a good snuggle.  Skittles, I loved that time you tried to jump on the bookshelf but completely missed and fell. I laughed for days. Don’t leave out the positive You might be more concerned with your cat’s negative behaviors but it’s important to show appreciation where it is due. Again, follow the SBI model: “Skittles, I loved that time you tried to jump on the bookshelf but completely missed and fell. I laughed for days. The video got me over 50 likes on Instagram.” Remember it’s your job to support your cats as they grow, encourage them to lean in, and work hard at being cats.

"<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br></p><p>Plants need light to survive. Plants make their own food from light energy, carbon dioxide, water, nutrients and minerals.

"<p>Plants in water (aquatic plants) also need light to make their own water. Aquatic plants absorb carbon dioxide, water and minerals directly from the surrounding water. Photosynthesis in aquatic plants produces nutrients for plants and releases oxygen into the water, which, for example, fish need to breathe.

"<p>Next in line is the lens which acts like the lens in a camera, helping to focus light to the back of the eye.<br>The very back of the eye is lined with a layer called the retina <br>which is similar to the film in a camera. The retina is a membrane <br>containing photoreceptor nerve cells that line the inside back wall of <br>the eye. The receptor cells (rods and cones) of the retina change the <br>light rays into electrical impulses and send them through the optic <br>nerve to the brain where an image is perceived. The center 10% of the <br>retina is called the macula. This is responsible for your sharp vision, <br>your reading vision.<br>The peripheral retina is responsible for the peripheral vision.

There may be many reasons why one race of people believes they are superior to another but a great majority of people don’t truly know why they react the way; they just do; many just on the sight of someone of a different race.<br>         Today we will attempt to examine, from a social learning perspective, the root causes of racism as well as the culture and the effects racism has upon society.</p>",100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,0%,0%,0%,100%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Hello Scientists!! We already know about the property of rectilinear propagation of light, that is, light travels in a straight line. Formation of shadows and eclipses are direct consequences of rectilinear propagation of light. Similarly, formation of day and night suggests that light travels in a straight line (see the figure below). If it was not so, the light would have curved around the earth and there would have been sunlight during night. When a beam of sunlight enters a dark room through a small hole, we can see a beam of light travelling in a straight line. Watch the demonstration of the rectilinear propagation of light below. Here, three cardboards are taken (A,B and C) with fine holes at their centres. A lighted candle is placed on one side and boards are arranged such that the holes are in the straight line. Viewing from the other side, it is found that light from the candle is seen only if all the three holes are in the straight line. If one of the cardboard is displaced sideways, light is no longer seen. This clearly shows that light travels in a straight line.",100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Today, half of the world’s population are still not online. While Asia has the highest number of people without access, Africa leads the world in the percentage of the population without connection at 88 percent. Furthermore, in the countries that are connected, male internet users outnumber their female counterparts in every region of the world. The ‘digital divide’ we face globally does not just signify those who have access to the internet and those who do not, the gap also encompasses a number of other discrepancies, including the quality of digital infrastructure in rural communities, the speed of connectivity in remote areas, and the training and skills required to navigate such technology.   Digital technologies continue to spread rapidly while providing a myriad of benefits – boosting economic growth and efficiency, enabling a more productive workforce, improving service delivery, and expanding educational opportunity.  However, the advantages brought forth by digital innovation largely depend on internet connectivity, and thus the benefits remain unevenly distributed across the world. In order for everyone to participate in, and contribute to the digital economy, closing the gap in internet access is critical.    The Mohammed bin Rashid Initiative for Global Prosperity seeks new tools to deploy these existing technologies to remote populations in a sustainable and affordable way. To do so, the initiative welcomes manufactured products and solutions from innovators and makers around the world that:  - Propose innovative methods to bolster and scale the use of existing technologies to accelerate the distribution of connection globally   - Create affordable opportunities for underserved communities to access digital technologies through ready-to-deploy products and strategies  - Promote equitable use of digital services and technology, empowering marginalised communities to overcome barriers to digital literacy, education, and economic opportunities  Are you the 1 that can address the digital divide?

"<p><strong>Step 2: Research Question Formulation</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">You have now been introduced to the different variables in the <em>Sexual Selection in Guppies</em> virtual laboratory. Before performing experiments you need to form an overview of your research topic and decide what you want to know. You do this by formulating research questions. A research question is a question you can answer by doing experiments.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Use the Question Scratchpad app to formulate your questions. </em><em>Please think of research questions that can be answered by doing experiments in the Sexual Selection in Guppies virtual laboratory. </em><em>Press the help button (?) to learn how to use the Question Scratchpad app.</em></p>",0%,0%,100%,0%,0%,TRUE,0%,100%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,0%,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,0%,0%,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"<p><strong>Step 3: Hypothesis Generation</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Your next step is to formulate <strong>three </strong><strong>hypotheses</strong>. Hypotheses give predictions of the effects of certain variables. Scientists use all the knowledge and information they have collected about their research topic to make an educated guess about the outcome of the experiments. Take a look at your research question(s). Can you make an educated guess about the answer of your question(s) based on the knowledge you have collected in the previous phase? This educated guess will be your hypothesis. Sometimes you might be able to formulate more than one hypothesis per question.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">When you have formulated your hypotheses, think about how confident are you that they are true? Use the confidence indicator on the right side of the hypothesis to indicate this level of confidence. If the indicator is purple you are 100% confident. If the circle is grey you are not at all confident.</p><p><em>Please use the Hypothesis Scratchpad app below to formulate your 3 hypotheses. </em></p>",0%,0%,100%,0%,0%,TRUE,0%,100%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,100%,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,0%,0%,100%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This arrangement is called a “<strong>simple electrical circuit</strong>"". Each of the three electrical elements of the simple electric circuit (namely, the wire, the battery, and the bulb) has two electrical ends, which are called “<strong>conductive parts</strong>"". Conductive parts must connect in series in a closed circular arrangement. This means that one of the conductive parts of the battery needs to connect to a conductive part of the bulb. The free part of the bulb connects to an end of the wire and the free end of the wire connects to the free part of the battery. The battery creates a<strong> potential difference</strong>, which is called “<strong>voltage</strong>"", and forces electrons to flow from the negative to the positive side of the battery. More specifically, the chemical reactions in a battery cause a buildup of electrons at the negative pole of the battery and thus there is an electrical difference between the two sides (the negative and the positive). The electrons want to move to a place with fewer electrons, but this cannot be done through the battery. When a circuit is closed (that means the two sides of a battery are connected with a conductive material) electrons find a way to move from the negative to the positive side.</p>",50%,0%,0%,0%,0%,FALSE,50%,0%,0%,0%,0%,FALSE,50%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,FALSE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,50%,FALSE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"<p><em></em>Dear Student,</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">In today's lesson you will learn about the importance of natural and sexual selection processes in understanding evolution. To study these topics you will work through five inquiry phases (Orientation, Conceptualization, Investigation, Conclusion and Discussion). In addition to learning about biology you will also acquire important skills for conducting scientific inquiry. You will perform experiments with the online virtual laboratory Sexual Selection in Guppies and collect and analyze data just like the biologist John Endler did when he first investigated the balance of natural and sexual selection in guppy fish in the 1970s.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Let's begin with a question: </p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Is it always good for a person or an animal to look beautiful?</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Today you will answer this question using evidence gathered from an inquiry investigation. The answer relates very much to understanding the evolutionary processes of natural and sexual selection.

"<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>When the biologist John Endler observed wild guppies in Trinidad in the 1970s, he was puzzled by the fact that male guppies exhibited a wide variation in physical appearance depending on which part of a stream they lived in. Male guppies in one part of a stream had many colourful spots on their sides, whereas male guppies in another location were relatively dull and showed only a few spots. Something must have been responsible for causing these variations.</em></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Step 1: Introduction to Guppy Experiments</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">To investigate the variation of spots in guppies the biologist John Endler performed experiments in an artificial pond and varied certain variables he thought influenced the average number of spots per male guppy.

"<p><strong>Step 3: Hypothesis Generation</strong></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Your next step is to formulate <strong>three </strong><strong>hypotheses</strong>. Hypotheses give predictions of the effects of certain variables. Scientists use all the knowledge and information they have collected about their research topic to make an educated guess about the outcome of the experiments. Take a look at your research question(s). Can you make an educated guess about the answer of your question(s) based on the knowledge you have collected in the previous phase? This educated guess will be your hypothesis. Sometimes you might be able to formulate more than one hypothesis per question.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">When you have formulated your hypotheses, think about how confident are you that they are true?

"Plate Tectonics - A Documentary:   An informative documentary from Isaac Frame. Ever thought of how the continents were formed? How they oddly just, ""fit together."" Well there is a simple answer, and it is revealed through a process called plate tectonics. It answers the whole issue of continental drift, and is more concrete than an ""expanding earth"" theory. This subject covers a variety of processes including subduction, transduction, etc. Enjoy the video!",50%,0%,0%,0%,0%,FALSE,50%,0%,0%,0%,0%,FALSE,50%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,FALSE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,50%,FALSE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Six Thinking Hats Edward de Bono's (2000) Six Thinking Hats is a widely adopted creativity technique in various fields such as business management, education, and human-computer interaction. Essentially, Six Thinking Hats provides directions for adopting different modes of thinking, characterized by six coloured hats: White, Red, Black, Yellow, Green and Blue (Table 1). Table 1: Six colour hats, focus of thinking and implication to Go-Lab inquiry learning phases Thinking hats Focus Inquiry Learning Phases Applicable Facts Figures Facts, Orientation, Conclusion, Discussion: Information Figures Call for information known and Information needed, which can be provided by a teacher, peers and other sources. Such information may need to be referenced for supporting discussion as well as conclusion. Intuition Intuition, Discussion: In reflecting and Emotion Feeling & communicating experiences and Emotion insights gained in the learning Judgment process, students may express Caution feelings and emotions (e.g., fun, pride, frustration, surprise) to make their points. Judgment Conceptualization, Investigation: & Caution Spot the difficulties and risks; find out where and why things may go wrong. In formulating questions and hypotheses, it is critical to think about counterarguments and potential pitfalls. Logical Positive Logical Conceptualization, Investigation, Positive Conclusion: Explore the positives and probe for value and benefit. Optimism (but remain alert to biases) sustains engagement in the process. Creativity Creativity & Conceptualization: Identify the Changes Alternatives possibilities, alternatives and new ideas; an opportunity to express new concepts and new perceptions. Overview Overview All phases: It works as a control Process control Process mechanism to ensure that the control guidelines for different modes of thinking are observed. It is essentially a meta-cognitive strategy. Normally this creativity technique is applied in a group setting. Participants can wear real physical hats or mental ones (i.e., by asking all group members to utter loudly together the colour of the hat or presenting the image of the hat in a way perceivable by all of them). To ensure that participants are aware of the specific thinking mode they are in, thereby thinking with the same focus, it is important that putting on and taking off hats are performed as explicit actions (i.e., gesturing or verbalizing the change of hat). Also, group members should use the same colour hat simultaneously. By switching hats, participants can refocus or redirect their thoughts and interactions (verbal as well as non-verbal). Furthermore, the hats can be used in any order that is deemed appropriate and can be repeated as many times as necessary to address the issue at hand. In fact, the Six Thinking Hats technique has been applied to teach STEM subjects (Childs, 2012; Garner & Lock, 2010) with several advantages being identified. In summary, it can: reflect the process of experimentation within STEM subjects; help simplify and hence provide focus on one process at a time; enable a collaborative group learning activity; provide a common language within a group, while removing ego and reducing confrontation; promote creativity and problem solving; stimulate diversity of thought and empathy; foster evaluation skills leading back to improving processes and testing new hypothesis; Implementing Six Thinking Hats in the Go-Lab basic pedagogical model is relatively straightforward, as illustrated and described in Figure 1. Note that the teacher is required to orchestrate the process of switching hats, because it is a collaborative activity. However, if the class size is big, synchronizing the process may be somewhat difficult. Alternatively, the class can be split into smaller groups. For each group, a group leader is identified; he or she is responsible to coordinate the timing for changing hats and to ensure that members are applying the same focus (Table 1) to think about the issue under scrutiny. Figure 1: Example of applying different colour Thinking Hats to the inquiry learning phases While Figure 1 exemplifies which colour Hats are applicable for which inquiry learning phases, there is much leeway for a teacher (or a student group leader) to adapt the use of Hats based on the abilities as well as preferences of group members, the group dynamics, and certain situational factors.

"<p><strong>Vaccinations are often in the news nowadays</strong>. One reason is that more and more vaccinations are becoming available (e.g. meningitis, rotavirus-caused diarrhea and HPV) or are in progress (e.g. AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis). Another reason are the <strong>universal vaccination programs</strong>, which strive for as high vaccination rates as possible (preferrably higher than 95%).</p><p>The reason for such high percentages is not only to protect the people getting vaccinated, but also to protect those who cannot be vaccinated (e.g. because they are too young or because their immune system is too fragile). The high percentages of vaccinated people will provide what is called <strong>herd immunity</strong>; those who are not vaccinated have then a very small chance to get infected, since the diseases won't spread due to the high percentage of vaccinated people.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Below are two news articles about the rotavirus vaccination results in India and the Measles outbreak in New York.</em></p>",50%,0%,0%,0%,0%,FALSE,50%,0%,0%,0%,0%,FALSE,50%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,FALSE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,50%,FALSE,0%,0%,0%,0%,0%,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
